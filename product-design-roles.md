### Visual Design
Demonstrates taste in layout, typography and visual hierarchy, as it pertains to BuzzFeed’s brand and products.

### Brand
Adheres to the holistic design vision of BuzzFeed, across products and platforms.

### Patterns
Follows existing visual and UX patterns, whether specific to BuzzFeed and/or platform, to ensure a consistent and intuitive experience across all of BuzzFeed’s features and products.

### UX Design
Familiarity with information architecture, multi-step and cross-platform flows. Consistently considers the holistic user experience and potential states (errors, successes, dead-ends) in the features they work on. Puts themselves in the shoes of the end-user and advocates that point of view to their Squad and the Product Design team.

### Process
Adopts our transparent, defined design process, which includes understanding project definition and scope, artifact creation, solicitation of feedback, iteration, prototyping, quality assurance, shipping and learning.

### Toolkit
Employs design tools to solve and communicate user flows, interaction and motion. These tools include sketching, diagramming, interface design tools (Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator), production HTML/CSS for the Web, or native prototyping tools (Framer, Principle) for Mobile.

### Transparency
Shares work early and often and seeks out constructive feedback from their manager, stakeholders, squads and the Product Design team — in Basecamp (at least once per week for active projects), presentations and Crits — and actively works with their manager to filter and prioritize this feedback.

### Experiments
Considers the project’s key metrics when working through design problems.

### Fluency
Communicates with product leads and engineers in their language, designing with consideration for their cares and concerns. Proactively works with their manager to negotiate thoughtful design outcomes when there are cross-discipline concerns.

### Writing
Actively improving their ability to communicate ideas clearly and succinctly in Basecamp, in documentation and over email, by soliciting feedback from their manager, other designers and their Squad. Writes direct, consistent and action-oriented UI copy.

### Mentorship
Provides direct and impactful feedback in Group Crit, and engages peers in their work. Seeks out feedback from other designers, to grow their own skills and design toolkit.

### Culture
Contributes not only to the products they work on, but to their Squad as a whole. Identifies design-led projects and collaborates with other disciplines and departments. Spreads design thinking and enthusiasm across their Squad.
